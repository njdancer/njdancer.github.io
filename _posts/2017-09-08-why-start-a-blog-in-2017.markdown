title: So, Why start a blog in 2017?
---
We live in an age with few limitations on self expression. Social media is fast becoming one of the dominant forms of communication and content platforms of all types continue to take off. In this environment the question I am often asking myself is not whether to post, or what to post, but where to post.

While I've long wanted a place to share my ideas and experiments, that question has held me back. Platforms like Facebook are great for keeping in touch with friends but for specific topics are very likely to just limit your audience to those who aren't interested. Twitter is obviously incredibly powerful for generating public conversation but does not support long form content and is difficult to use effectively with few followers. There are also CMS platforms like Medium which have taken the publishing world by storm, yet for all the powerful functionality they provide it has always felt like this comes at the cost of flexibility that you may regret in the future.

This has led me to(finally) start a blog.


### What do you have to say though?

A lot, and not much. I guess the answer is I'm not really sure. The blog is likely to be kept to technology topics. Specifically documenting the projects I've been working on and problems I've been trying to solve. In some ways this will largely be like a journal serving as a place to store my thoughts to refer back to later. By putting this online though, I'm hoping to start a conversation with others and possibly help some others along the way.

Speaking of conversation, you may also notice there is currently no commenting system in place. This is to try and reduce the amount of time required to maintain the blog hopefully encouraging me to post more. I also think the last thing people need in 2017 is another place to have a conversation so for now twitter will be the meeting place of choice.
